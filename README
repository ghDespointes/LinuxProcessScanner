List of submitted source code
	phunt.cpp
	makefile

Created a program which:
	Takes and parses inputs in the wanted format
	Parses a configuration file to get all the blacklist rules inside
	Every 5 seconds it acquires all the data of live processes
	With that data it compares the process data with the rules to decide whether to act on that process
	Either kills, suspends, or nice any violating processes
	Logs any action into a log file

Code and code Layout:
	Its all found in 1 file
	Relevant methods are kept near each other.

	Input are stored in a struct with:
		log file location 	l
		conf file location 	c
		deamonize value	 	d   (Doesn't do anything, didn't do extra credit)

	Blacklist rules are stored as Commands in the form of:
		action	(kill, suspend, or nice) decide how to deal with the program
		type		(user, path, or mem) what to check to see if violating
		param		the parameter to check for, changes based on type

	Process data is stored as ProcData:
		ID		The process ID
		user 	user of the process by name
		path	the path of the process
		size 	the ammount of mem being used

	This is how the code flows:

	Setup:
		Input is parsed
		Blacklist requirements are parsed and stored
		Logfile is set up to print values

	Loop:
		Get all the procs in /proc/
		Get the size, user, and path of each of those procs and save them
		Now for each proc apply each command until is done or no commands are relevant.
		Log any activity that is done to processes
		Then repeat every 5 seconds

General comments and descisions made:
	I am using 2 of my free days.

	When trying to kill a process, i check to see if the program is killed in 2 ways. This is to check cheaply whether the files exists at all. Later it more expensivly checks the actual state of the process. Its redudant but i didn't want it to spin infinitly because the process exists but its dead or a zombie.
	There are wanrnings when compiling but they can be ignored	

Number of Hours spent and effort level:
	Around 8 and medium effort
	Mostly straightforward after talking to you, but some hurdles to get through. Mostly involves researching where data is located and how to properlly access it.
